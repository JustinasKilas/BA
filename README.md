# BA IT Challenge: Baltic Amadeus .NET 2018

## Project Overview

This project is part of the Baltic Amadeus IT Challenge. It focuses on processing and analyzing data related to kindergartens. Written in .NET, the application reads a CSV file and performs various operations to gather insights into the dataset.

## Original Task

The original task description could not be found, but the general requirements were to:

1. Read a CSV file named `input.txt` that contains information about kindergartens. The file should be in the same folder as the script.
2. Extract statistics, such as:
   - Maximum and minimum values from the `CHILDS_COUNT` column.
   - Abbreviations of the rows with maximum and minimum child counts.
   - Percentage of free space left for each language.
   - List of kindergartens with 2 to 5 free spaces, grouped by name and sorted in descending order by name.
  
## Output

All the resulting information is stored in an output file for further analysis or reporting.
